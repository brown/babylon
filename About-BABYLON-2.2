BABYLON Version 2.2

BABYLON is a modular, configurable, hybrid environment for 
developing expert systems. It provides the following knowledge representation 
formalisms: objects, rules with forward and backward 
chaining, Prolog and constraints. BABYLON is implemented and 
embedded in Common Lisp.

For a description of the knowledge representation formalisms, the
interpreters, and the use of BABLYON on the MAC, see the enclosed
MS WORD (Macintosh version) documents in the folder Docs-and-Readme.

The folder BABYLON-2.2 contains all the sources that are needed
to compile and run BABYLON on different hard and software 
platforms (Mac, TI, Symbolics 36XX, Sun). 

BABYLON 2.2 is the successor version of BABYLON 2.1.7.
It now runs under Common Lisp II implementations,  for example 
Macintosh Common Lisp 2.0 (MCL) or Allegro Version 4.x.
